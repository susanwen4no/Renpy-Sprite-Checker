# Renpy-Sprite-Checker
Organizational tool to help correspondences between writing and sprite art assets

Have you ever been working on a visual novel in Ren'Py and needed to script in the expressions for your visual novel script only to have realized you don't really know what calls go with which expressions? And as much as you might hope your team has created an expression reference sheet, maybe that's not enough.

That is why I am creating this Ren'py sprite checker that will allow you to reference expressions without having to dig through your .png files and go through unneeded trouble.

## How to Use

* Replace the /images folder with a folder of your image assets
* Replace assets.rpy with a .rpy file including all of your necessary sprite/layered image set up

## Goals

* GUI based dress-up game style display

## Completed

* Text input display
  * By typing in the name of the sprite you want to check, check how the sprite looks. (ex. *chris smile*)

## Notes

Currently, the images and assets files used are from my visual novel demo of Pomegranate Fruit. These assets can be considered placeholders for the time being.
